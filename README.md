Here’s a **generated `README.md`** for your **teach-the-llm** GitHub repository based on the description and purpose of the project:

---

# 🧠 Teach-The-LLM

**Teach-The-LLM** is a Python project dedicated to fine-tuning open-weight large language models (LLMs) to improve **tool calling ability** and **response quality** for a **property agent application**.

This repository is a personal journey of experimentation and engineering toward building more capable agent models that understand real-world property-related queries and integrate with external tools (APIs, databases, etc.).

---

## 🚀 Features

✨ Fine-tune open-weight LLMs
🔧 Improve **tool calling** capability (function/tool interaction)
👩‍💼 Enhance responses for **property agent use-cases**
📦 Python-based modular workflows

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 💻 Requirements

Make sure you have:

* Python 3.10+
* Virtual environment (recommended)

### 🧩 Install Dependencies

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*(If you have a `requirements.txt` add one accordingly — alternatively use `pyproject.toml` with Poetry or PDM.)*

---

## 🔥 Usage

### 🧪 Run the main script

```bash
python main.py
```

This script will load your model and run training or evaluation logic to fine-tune the LLM based on your configuration.

*(Add flags/arguments as required depending on your CLI setup.)*

---

## 🧠 Fine-Tuning Approach

The goal is to:

1. **Load open-weight models**
2. Train them on property agent-specific datasets
3. Improve prompt handling and tool integrations
4. Evaluate performance improvements

---

## 📁 Models & Data

This project assumes:

* You have access to open-weight LLM checkpoints
