I've found some great one-bedroom options that should work perfectly for you and your dog. Both have **no weight restrictions**:\n\n**Unit 3B** - $1,450/month\n- 680 sq ft, 1 bed/1 bath\n- Available Feb 15th\n- $300 pet deposit, no weight limit\n\n**Unit 12A** - $1,525/month  \n- 720 sq ft, 1 bed/1 bath\n- Available Feb 10th (5 days sooner)\n- $350 deposit + $25/month pet rent, no weight restrictions\n\nThe main difference is that 12A is a bit larger and available sooner, but has a small monthly pet fee. Would you like me to schedule a tour of either unit?"

Unit 8D is available February 20th for $2,950/month with 2.5 bathrooms, also pet-friendly. Even the third option, Unit 15B, is available mid-March for $2,800/month. Would you like me to send you details on any of these? It might be worth securing something earlier!"

Here's a complete breakdown of your move-in costs:\n\n**Upfront Fees:**\n• Security Deposit: Equal to one month's rent ($1,200-$2,800) - refundable\n• Application Fee: $50 per adult (non-refundable)\n• Administrative Fee: $150 one-time (non-refundable)\n• First Month's Rent: Due at signing (prorated if moving in mid-month at $40-93/day)\n\n**If You Have Pets:**\n• Pet Deposit: $300 per pet (refundable)\n• Pet Fee: $200 per pet (non-refundable)\n• Monthly Pet Rent: $35 per pet\n\n**Other Costs:**\n• Utility Connection Fee: $25 (on first bill)\n• Monthly Utility Package: $65 for water/trash/sewage\n\nSo for a typical 1-bedroom at $1,500/month without pets, you'd need roughly $1,900-$3,400 total to move in. Want me to calculate the exact amount for a specific unit you're interested in?"

We do use the standard industry practice of requiring 3 times the monthly rent in gross income. So for an $1,800 apartment, you'd need a minimum monthly income of $5,400. We also look for a credit score of 620 or higher, positive rental history, and will need verifiable proof of income through pay stubs or tax returns. It's great that you're familiar with the process - these are indeed pretty standard criteria across most properties!"

Available February 1st.\n\n**Unit 12B** is a two-bedroom, two-bathroom for $1,850/month. If you expect guests fairly often, this is ideal - they'd have their own private space and bathroom. Available March 1st, also pet-friendly.\n\nWhich of these sounds like the right fit for you? I'd be happy to schedule a tour or answer any questions!"

I found two available units that might help you decide:\n\n**Unit 5A** - 1 Bedroom, 1 Bathroom\n- $1,500/month, 650 sq ft\n- Available February 1st\n- Pet-friendly\n\n**Unit 8C** - 2 Bedrooms, 2 Bathrooms  \n- $2,100/month, 950 sq ft\n- Available March 15th\n- Pet-friendly\n\nThe 2-bedroom gives you 300 more square feet and an extra bathroom for $600 more per month, which could be great if you need office space or have frequent guests. The 1-bedroom is more budget-friendly and available sooner. What factors are most important in your decision?"

It's available 24/7 with your resident key fob, and you'll get instant email and text notifications with a pickup code whenever a package arrives. We can hold packages for up to 7 days, and we even have refrigerated lockers for grocery deliveries. The room is monitored by CCTV for added security.

When you renew your lease, your rent may increase depending on current market conditions. Typically, our residents see increases of about 2% to 5% annually. You'll receive written notice of any change at least 60 days before your lease expires, which gives you a full 30 days to decide. The exact amount depends on a few things like how long your new lease term is (longer terms often get lower increases) and your payment history - residents who've paid on time may qualify for better rates. Some of our floor plans even have rent-lock guarantees for 12-month renewals! I'd be happy to check if there are any early renewal incentives available for your specific unit. Would you like me to look into that?"

We offer short term leases from 3 to 12 months. For a 6-month lease, there's a $150 monthly premium over our standard rates. We currently have several 1-bedroom units available for 6-12 month terms, which would be perfect for your work assignment. We also have studio options for 3-6 months if you want something even shorter.\n\nSince availability changes pretty often, your best bet is to call our leasing office directly at (555) 123-4567 to see what's available right now and schedule a tour. They can also tell you about any corporate housing options that might work for your situation.\n\nWould you like to know more about what's included in our units or the application process?"

If you decide not to renew your lease, here's what you can expect:\n\n**Notice Requirements:**\nYou'll need to submit written notice at least 60 days before your lease expires through the resident portal or directly at our leasing office. This is really important—if notice isn't given on time, your lease may automatically convert to a more expensive month-to-month arrangement (usually 125-150% of your current rent).\n\n**Move-Out Process:**\nOnce we receive your notice, we'll send you detailed move-out instructions about 45 days before your lease ends. You can also schedule a pre-move-out inspection two weeks prior to identify any potential issues. Your security deposit will be returned within 30 days after you move out, minus any charges for damages or outstanding balances.\n\n**Important:** You're responsible for rent through the entire lease term, and utilities must stay active until your official move-out date.\n\n**If You Stay Past Your Lease End:**\nThis would be considered a holdover tenancy and can result in daily fees ($50-100/day), potential eviction proceedings, and negative impacts on your rental history and credit score—so it's definitely something to avoid!\n\nDo you have any questions about the notice process or move-out timeline? I'm happy to help you plan ahead!"

Right around the corner (just a 5-minute walk) is a Whole Foods Market for organic and natural foods. If you're up for a slightly longer walk, Trader Joe's is about 15 minutes away and offers great specialty items at good prices.\n\nFor more traditional supermarket shopping, there's a Safeway about a 4-minute drive away that's open 24 hours and offers delivery. And if you're looking to save money, Aldi is just a 5-minute drive with excellent prices on staples.\n\nWould you like more details about any of these stores?"

I'd be happy to help with your family visit question. Our guest policy allows family members to stay for up to 14 consecutive days without any special approval. For a month-long visit, you would need to request management approval since stays between 15-30 days require extended visitor registration.\n\nHere's what you should know:\n• Maximum guest stay is 30 days per calendar year\n• There's a $100 extended stay fee for visits over 14 days\n• You'll need to register your family members by submitting a Guest Registration Form at least 5 days before they hit the 15-day mark\n• The form requires their photo ID and contact information\n\nWould you like me to help you get the registration process started or check your unit's specific occupancy limits?"

Our noise policy is set up to be fair and give residents multiple chances to adjust. Here's how it works:\n\n**First time**: You'll get a friendly verbal warning after management verifies the complaint. We document it, but it's really just a reminder.\n\n**Second time**: A formal written warning is sent via email and posted to your resident portal. This stays on file for a year.\n\n**Third time**: There's a $75 fine, and we'll schedule a brief meeting with our community manager to chat about what's going on.\n\n**If issues continue**: Each additional violation results in a $150 fine, and four or more verified complaints within 6 months could lead to lease termination (though that's rare).\n\n**Important to know**: We don't just take someone's word for it—our team investigates every complaint by talking with neighbors and sometimes doing a courtesy check before any warning is issued.\n\nOur quiet hours are 10 PM to 8 AM on weeknights, and 11 PM to 9 AM on weekends. Is there anything specific about what's considered \"excessive noise\" that I can help clarify? I want to make sure you feel confident about the guidelines!"

We do have a modification policy in place to ensure everything is done safely and properly. Here's what you'll need to do:\n\n1. Submit a Modification Request Form through your resident portal (under 'Maintenance & Modifications')\n2. Include photos of the current fixtures and details about your new fixtures\n3. Provide credentials for a licensed electrician who will perform the installation\n4. Keep all original fixtures to reinstall when you move out\n\nThe approval process takes about 3 business days. Would you like me to walk you through accessing the resident portal or help you find where to submit the request form?"

You'll need your lease start date and unit address, and there's a $25 setup fee on your first bill.\n\n**Internet/Cable**: You have two options - FiberNet (1-800-555-0199, starting at $49/month) or StreamFast (1-800-555-0188, starting at $45/month). Both can do same-day installation if your unit is ready.\n\n**Trash & Recycling**: Trash is collected Tuesdays and Fridays, recycling on Wednesdays. Bins are behind Building C. For bulk items, just request pickup through the resident portal with 48 hours notice.\n\nIs there anything specific you'd like more details on?"

Good news - I found 2 two-bedroom units that fit your budget:\n\n**Unit 5B** is $1,850/month, has 1 bathroom, 850 sq ft, and is available June 1st. It's also pet-friendly, which is a nice bonus!\n\n**Unit 12C** is $1,950/month, has 2 bathrooms, 920 sq ft, and is available June 15th. Please note this one doesn't allow pets.\n\nSince you're sharing with a roommate, that extra bathroom in 12C might be worth the additional $100/month. Would you like me to schedule a tour for either of these?"

I found three units that fit what you're looking for.\n\nFor 4-bedrooms, there's Unit 12C - it's 2,100 square feet with 3 bathrooms, going for $3,200 a month and available February 15th. It's also pet-friendly, which is great if you have furry family members! There's also Unit 15A, another 4-bedroom at 2,050 square feet with 2.5 bathrooms for $3,100/month, available February 20th, and it allows pets too.\n\nIf you need that extra bedroom, Unit 8B has 5 bedrooms, 3.5 bathrooms, and a generous 2,500 square feet of space for $3,800/month, available March 1st. Just note that this one isn't pet-friendly.\n\nAll three would be wonderful for a family. Which one catches your eye, or would you like to schedule a tour to see them in person?"
